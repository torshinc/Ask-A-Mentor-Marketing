			<h2>
				Ask A Mentor Privacy Policy
			</h2>

			<h3>
				1. Terms
			</h3>

			<p>
				New Teacher Center and Torsh Inc. take your privacy very seriously and we figure that you do too. Because we believe so strongly that the information you share with is private and should remain so, weâ€™ve decided to lay out exactly what you can expect from us when it comes to safeguarding the privacy of your information.
			</p>

			<h3>
				2. Information Collection And Use
			</h3>

			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					While using our site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Our goal is to provide you with a unique mentoring and feedback experience and as such we do need some personal information to make that happen. Here are some of the things we do with your information in order to provide you with a customized mentoring experience:

					<ul type="p">
						<li>Make your coaching sessions personal</li>
						<li>Store all of your past sessions</li>
						<li>Contact you about your account</li>
						<li>Send you email about our service</li>
						<li>Ask you for your feedback to help make our service better</li>
						<li>Respond to your email requests for information and/or technical support</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					You trust us with your Personal Information. So, we do everything we can to make sure your information is safe in our systems. Some things we will NOT do are:
					<ul type="i">
						<li>We WILL NOT sell your personal information to anyone</li>
						<li>We WILL NOT send you newsletters or promotional mail or email</li>
						<li>We will NOT share the contents of your sessions with your employer.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>
				3. Uploaded Videos and Supporting Documents
			</h3>
				Since we require that you upload a video (and sometimes supporting documents) with your mentoring requests, we want you to know that no mentor, supervisor or admin will see any of the videos or documents you upload UNLESS you share it with them.  After you share a video or document with a mentor, that mentor cannot share that video with anyone else. Additionally, the mentor cannot download or copy your video. Your video and documents are 100% private to you until you share it.
			<h3>
				4. Log Data
			</h3>

			<p>
				Like many sites, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site.  This log data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics.
			</p>

			<h3>
				5. Security
			</h3>

			<p>
				The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
			</p>

			<h3>
				6. Links To Other Sites
			</h3>

			<p>
				Our site may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.
			</p>

			<h3>
				7. Cookies
			</h3>

			<p>
				Cookies are files that your Web browser puts on your computer when you visit a Web site. We use cookies to tell us how often you visit our site, and what pages you go to on our site. Sometimes we use files from other companies (called third-party cookies) to help us see where people go on our website.  Unless you give us permission, the cookies we use do not store any personally identifying information.
