			<h2>
				Ask A Mentor Terms of Service (“Agreement”)
			</h2>

			<h3>
				Definitions
			</h3>

			<p>
				Ask A Mentor is a site that is operated jointly by the New Teacher Center and Torsh Inc.  Sometimes when we refer to Ask A Mentor we’ll say “Ask A Mentor” and sometimes we will say “we, “us”, or our. Don’t be confused, we’re talking about Ask A Mentor.  If you use  our site, then you are agreeing to these terms and conditions, which is a fancy way of saying that you have read the stuff we write below, and you agree to follow the rules. If you don’t think that you can follow the rules, then you shouldn’t use our site. To be clear, when we say “you” we mean anyone who signs on to our site and ask our mentors to help them; since this is a site for teachers who need help, you are most likely  a teacher.  We operate this site, which means we always have the right to change the rules at any time. Yep, that’s how we roll. If we do make changes, and you continue to use the site, that means that you are agreeing to follow the new rules. 			</p>

			<h3>
				Services
			</h3>

			<p>
				Ask A Mentor is a site that offers a service that makes it easy for teachers to find a mentor, ask a question and get valuable feedback in a short period of time. The mentors on the site work for us, but they are here to help you improve your practice. All of our mentors are experts in their field, and we try very hard to make sure they do good work, but we can’t guarantee that they’ll always do what they are supposed to do. When you interact with our mentors, you will do so through our site, but you need to make sure that you have a computer, internet service and any other software needed to get access to our site; this is your responsibility.  As with all websites, we may have to fix a thing or two, so every now and then we may shut down to perform maintenance; we promise that this will not take a lot of time and will be done in the wee hours when you are most likely sleeping.
			</p>

			<h3>
				Signing Up
			</h3>

			<p>
				To use our service, you will need to create a username and password. You know the drill, you have to keep your username and password to yourself and make sure you don’t disclose it to anyone.  If you don’t keep them safe, and someone else accesses your account (someone that you don’t want to), we are not responsible. When you create an account on our site, that account is for you and you are not allowed to share your username and password with anyone else to access your account. As we mentioned above, our mentors are our employees. They are here to help you. You cannot ask them to work for you and you cannot contact them to help you outside of our site. That is a no no and we take it very seriously.
			</p>

			<h3>
				User Content
			</h3>

			<p>
				Whenever you ask our mentors for help, we will require that you upload a video clip and other supporting materials so that our mentors can provide you with good feedback. We will keep this information private and will not share or disclose this information to anyone not affiliated with us.  Before you upload any videos or supporting materials with your videos, we absolutely require that you get the proper authorization and sign off to capture the video and to include the images of anyone who is captured in the video. We also require that you only upload supporting documents that you own or have the right to use. Additionally, we do not want you to upload or publish anything on our site that is pornographic, libelous, defamatory, threatening or obscene. This is so important to us, that if we find out that you uploaded videos or supporting documents that you either do not own, or did not get the proper permission to capture and upload, or you upload or publish materials that we find objectionable, we retain the right to immediately suspend or terminate your account without question. Even though we will not share your videos or documents with anyone who is not affiliated with us, sometimes our supervisors who manage and supervise our mentors will want to see how well our mentors are performing and those supervisors may look at some of your videos as a part of our quality control and mentor review process.
